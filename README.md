# Instructions for candidates

This is the Java version of the Payment Gateway challenge. If you haven't already read the [README.md](https://github.com/cko-recruitment) in the root of this organisation, please do so now. 

## Template structure

```
src/ - A skeleton SpringBoot Application

test/ - Some simple JUnit tests

imposters/ - contains the bank simulator configuration. Don't change this

.editorconfig - don't change this. It ensures a consistent set of rules for submissions when reformatting code

docker-compose.yml - configures the bank simulator
```

Feel free to change the structure of the solution, use a different library etc.
